# Applied ML Final Project

Author: Joanna Farris

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict home sale prices using a combination of numeric and categorical housing features. The notebook walks through the full workflow — exploring the dataset, selecting and encoding features, training regression models, evaluating their performance, and comparing multiple modeling pipelines. The goal is to understand which home characteristics are most useful for prediction and how different preprocessing steps impact model accuracy.
