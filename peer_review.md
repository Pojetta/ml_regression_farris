## 1. Clarity & Organization

The notebook is easy to read, and the steps mostly flow in a logical order. A brief intro at the very top explaining the project goal would make it even clearer. 

---

## 2. Feature Selection

Your feature choices make sense for the target you're predicting. The reasoning you gave was solid. To strengthen this section, you could tie the feature choices back to specific things you saw during exploration (plots, correlations, etc.).

---

## 3. Model Performance

You compared the models well and used consistent metrics, which makes the results easy to follow. One small improvement would be explaining what the performance numbers mean (for example, why a lower RMSE is better).  

---

## 4. Reflection

Your reflections are clear and realistic. You explained what went well and what was challenging. 

---

**Overall:**  
Great job. The notebook is easy to follow, the feature choices
